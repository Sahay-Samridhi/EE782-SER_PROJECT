# EE782-SER_PROJECT
Comparison of LSTM, Transformer (wav2vec2.0 and HuBERT) and CNN (VGGish) based methods for speech emotion recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER): A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models & Loss Functions
# 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive comparative study on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The project evaluates the performance of four distinct feature extractors—LSTM, VGGish, Wav2Vec 2.0, and HuBERT—paired with five different loss functions to determine the optimal combinations for capturing emotional cues in speech1.All experiments were conducted on the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, focusing on four emotion categories: anger, happiness, sadness, and neutral
